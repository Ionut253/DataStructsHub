# 🧩DataStructsHub
``` 
This repository showcases a collection of custom containers developed using various data structures in C++.
Each container is designed to facilitate key operations, including adding elements, removing elements, and
searching for elements.
Each implementation includes iterators, enhancing flexibility for traversing and manipulating the data.
```
## 🛠️Test Cases:
```
❗❗❗The test cases for all containers were provided by the lecturer of the Data Structures and Algorithms course
at the university, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of functionality.
The implementations of the containers and their associated iterators are the result of my own work and design.
```
